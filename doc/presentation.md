## Find the long-term behavior of code 1635.

What happens if one extends the picture above? Does the center region eventually become repetitive? Or does
it take over the whole pattern? How sensitive are the results to the details of the initial conditions used?

# Question

![Code 1635](../img/code-1635-smaller.png "Code 1635")

What happens if one extends the picture above? Does the center region eventually become repetitive? Or does
it take over the whole pattern? How sensitive are the results to the details of the initial conditions used?

I explored this question with programs I wrote in Python.  I used the *numpy*, *zlib*,
*pandas*, and *matplotlib.pyplot* libraries.

# Approaches to the problem

* Delineate the borders of the central region.  The borders are easy to see by eye
and it seems like they should be easy to find programmatically.  However, this
is easier said than done.  It could possibly be done by sliding a 'window' over
a particular row from left to right, looking at the values in that window.
You might have to increase the width of the window as you go down.  You have to
be a certain distance out to see the border.
* Look at the complexity of the successive rows.

# Complexity

![Code 1635](../img/code-1635-smaller.png "Code 1635")

The central region is complex.  The two border regions are repetitive, and, hence, not
complex.  The two middle regions, each between the center region and one of the 
border regions is simple.

# Complexity of successive generations

* In the previous picture, the complexity remains constant through successive
generations.  (At least it does once you go far enough down that the borders are stable.)
* If the center region eventually becomes repetitive, then the complexity over successive
generations should level off.  If the center region takes over the whole pattern, then
the complexity over successive generations should grow without bound.

# Measure complexity of generations

I measure the complexity of a row by how much `zlib.compress` will compress it.

As you can see the complexity indeed does decrease over the generations observed.

# Sensitivity to initial conditions

Previously we started with a single *1* in the center cell.  The screenshot below is from 
[Examples of 1D Three-Color Totalistic Cellular Automata](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ExamplesOf1DThreeColorTotalisticCellularAutomata/),
a Wolfram Demonstrations Project.

This is code 1635 with initial conditions of *[1, 1, 1]*.

![Code 1635-111](../img/code-1635-111-smaller.png "Code 1635-111")

It is markedly different than using the initial condition of *[1]*.  We would probably need
to run it for many more generation to see whether the central region
becomes complex.

# Initial conditions of [1, 1, 1]

# Conclusions

* All of this is experimental.  It doesn't prove anything.
* However, it indicates that the central region may eventually be repetitive.
* Need to look at more initial conditions.

** Does anyone have any suggestions on things to look at?**
